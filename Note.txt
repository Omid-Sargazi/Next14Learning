Routing Metadata
 Ensuring proper search engine optimization (SEO) is crucial for increasing visibility and attracting users.
 Next.js introduced the Metadata API which allows you to define metadata for each page.
 Metadata ensures accurate and relevant information is displayed when your pages abs shared or indexed.

 MetaData {
    Export a static metadata object 
    Export a dynamic generateMetadata function
 }

Metadata rules

1- Both layout.js and page.js files can export metadata. if define in a layout, it applies to all pages in that layout, but it define in page, it applies only to that page 
2- MetaData is read in order, from the root level down to the final page level.
3- when there's metadata in multiple places for the same route, they get combined, but page metadata will replace layout metadata if they have the same properties.
